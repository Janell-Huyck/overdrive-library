    This BookAdmin class courtesy of Dmitry Mugtasimov at

    Its purpose is to allow the admin page to display the
    holds field which is a many-to-many field and would
    normally not be displayed because it uses a "through" table.
    This is an issue with Django currently being worked on
    and tracked through the ticket linked above.  Note written: 7/9/2020
